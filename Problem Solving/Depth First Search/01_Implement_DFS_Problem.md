##  Implement Depth First Search (Uninformed Search)

1.  You are given an undirected or bidirected graph and a source from which you will start your journey 
    You have to find and print the list of vertices you can go from the source vertice given as input.  
    + First will have the total number of nodes **(n)**  and the total number of edges **(m)**.    
    + Next m lines will be followed by m pairs of integers denoting the bi-directional edges.  
        - **a   b**  
            + It means there is a connection from **a to b** and 
            + Also, a connection from **b to a**.
    + Then a single integer **s** denoting the source.  
1.  Use the idea of Graph traversal to solve the problem. Also use **recursive** method.  

1.  Outputs:  
    + Print the nodes in the order they are getting explored starting from the source node including in which depth level they were explored.  
    + Maximum depth Reached for the corresponding DFS.
